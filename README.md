# Implementation of Case-Based Reasoning for Pokemon Battles
Simple Implementation of Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) for pokemon battle rematches of the AI in the game. Not advanced but a foundation based on my current understanding of the pillars of CBR (Retain, Retrieve, Reuse, and Revise) and the code in this Decomp. Future work from either me or whoever wishes to work on it with better experience with the code or understanding to make it more advanced

-- Description of the implementation in Progress ... 

Recordings of CBR project located in `Case-Based Reasoning Project Videos` (Still in Progress to get part 2 uploaded)
Inside that folder is 3 parts of an entire video which are:
- Part 1 contains the default battle initially with the NPC before any CBR is active.
- Part 2 Rematch of NPC with the CBR implementation based on AI losing from prior match
- Part 3 Rematch of NPC with CBR implementation based on AI wining from prior match
