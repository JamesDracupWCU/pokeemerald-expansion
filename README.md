# Implementation of Case-Based Reasoning for Pokemon battles
### Basic Implementation of Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) for pokemon battle rematches of the AI in the game.

Future work from either me or whoever wishes to work on it with better experience with the code or understanding to make it more advanced.
